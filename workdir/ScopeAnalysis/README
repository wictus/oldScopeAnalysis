Aim
---
This example show a full dummy analysis of data from J-PET two strip prototype. 
It works with signals from SDA, but in principle should work with any dataset which has JPetRecoSignals

 * data from 2-strip setup with source at position [0,0]

Expected output
---------------

JPet.log file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following extensions are produced:

bareSource.reco.sig.offsets.analysisExample.5.root 
bareSource.reco.sig.timeAtThr.analysisExample.5.root
bareSource.reco.sig.phys.analysisExample.5.root
bareSource.reco.sig.hit.analysisExample.5.root
bareSource.reco.sig.position.analysisExample.5.root
bareSource.reco.sig.lor.analysisExample.5.root
bareSource.reco.sig.tof.analysisExample.5.root
points.txt

Description
--------------
The analysis is split into different modules and consists of:
* offset calculation
* time at threshold calculation
* conversion of RecoSignals into PhysSignals
* Hit matching of PhysSignals
* position of interaction, time of interaction and time difference calculation of Hits
* LOR matching of Hits
* TOF calculation of LOR, saving results for reconstruction in points.txt file

Additional info
--------------
In source code.

Compiling 
------------
make

Running
------------
Before running framework convert filenames using convertNames.sh script and in case when only 3 signals were gathered instead of 4 use makeDummyFile.sh.
Both scripts should be executed from directory with files.
To convert data from ASCII to framework binary:
./main.x -t scope -f config 
Then run analysis as in run.sh
